# Evaluation of Refactory: An APR Tool for Buggy Python Programs

Name: Priyadarshine Kumar 

Student ID: 40293041
# üõ†Ô∏è Tool Overview
## What is Refactory ?
- Refactory is a fully automated tool for generating real-time program repairs of buggy student programs, given one or more correct/reference programs.
## Why I selected Refactory:
- Refactory represents a state-of-the-art approach to automated program repair using refactoring-based techniques.
- The tool is particularly useful in educational contexts, such as repairing buggy student submissions for programming assignments.
- The tool‚Äôs innovative features, such as online refactoring and search-based synthesis, make it ideal for exploring advanced software engineering tools.
  
## How it works:
- Refactory repairs buggy Python programs by aligning them with semantically equivalent correct programs derived through online or offline refactoring.
- It identifies the closest matching refactored program based on control flow structure, infers input-output specifications, and performs search-based synthesis to repair buggy code.
- The tool supports customizable sampling rates, multiple repair phases (refactoring, mutation, and block repair), and generates detailed logs for analysis.
  
# üöÄ Running the Tool
## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Cloning the Repository
The repository was cloned using the following command:`git clone https://github.com/githubhuyang/refactory.git`

*Figure 1: The repository is cloned using the `git clone` command, preparing the environment for further steps.*

## üê≥ Step 2: Building the Docker Image
The Docker image was built using the following command:`docker build -t refactory ./docker/`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3385eba-8b4a-478a-86de-7fe99d47856c) 
*Figure 2: The Docker image is built using the `docker build` command, packaging the Refactory tool into a container.*

## üèÉ Step 3: Running Refactory in a Docker Container
The Docker container was started with the following command:`docker run -it --name refactory_container refactory`

*Figure 3: The Refactory tool is run in an isolated Docker container using the `docker run` command, with the required data mounted as a volume.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Executing Refactory on Sample Data
Refactory was run on the question_1 dataset using the following command:`python3 run.py -d ./data -q question_1 -s 100 -o -m -b`

| **Flag** | **Description**                                                   | **Example Usage**                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `-d`     | Specifies the dataset directory.                                  | `-d ./data`                           |
| `-q`     | Specifies the question folder.                                    | `-q question_1`                       |
| `-s`     | Sampling rate (percentage of correct programs to use).            | `-s 100` (100% sampling rate)         |
| `-o`     | Enables the **online refactoring** phase.                         | `-o`                                  |
| `-m`     | Enables the **structure mutation** phase.                         | `-m`                                  |
| `-b`     | Enables the **block repair** phase.                               | `-b`                                  |
